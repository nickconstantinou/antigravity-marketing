# Skill 03: Keyword Research
Implement the '6 Circles' framework to map intent:
1. Circle 1: Product-specific (High intent).
2. Circle 2: Direct alternatives/competitors.
3. Circle 3: Problem-solving (The "How-to").
4. Circle 4: Use-case specific.
5. Circle 5: Demographic interests.
6. Circle 6: Cultural zeitgeist.
- **Protocol:** Use Playwright/Perplexity MCP to find 'Salt' in circles 1-3. Prioritize low-competition/high-emotion queries.
